Fredo and Array Update
Max. score: 100
Fredo is assigned a new task today. He is given an array A containing N integers. His task is to update all elements of array to some minimum value x , that is,  ;  such that sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Note that x should be as minimum as possible such that sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.

Input Format:
First line of input consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A.
Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array elements.

Output Format:
The only line of output consists of the value of x.

Input Constraints:


SAMPLE INPUT 
5
1 2 3 4 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
4
Explanation
Initial sum of array =1+2+3+4+5=15
When we update all elements to 4, sum of array =4+4+4+4+4=20 which is greater than 15.
Note that if we had updated the array elements to 3,  which is not greater than sum=15 . So, 4 is the minimum value to which array elements need to be updated.




#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   int no_of_elements, element_i;
   scanf("%d", &no_of_elements);

   int sum = 0;
   for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
   {
       scanf("%d", &element_i);
       sum += element_i;
   }

   int x = sum/no_of_elements + 1 ;

   printf("%d\n", x);

   return 0;
}
